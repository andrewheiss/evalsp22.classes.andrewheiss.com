## Slides

**Important!!**: In the "Class details" video, I say that there are three books for the class: the World Bank evaluation book, *'Metrics Matter*, and *Causal Inference: The Mixtape*. [That's not the case this semseter](/syllabus/#books), since we're using the new *The Effect* book, which replaces both *'Metrics Matter* and the *Mixtape*. So ignore that part of the video. The slides are updated with the correct books, though: [see here](/slides/01-slides.html#85).

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

`r blogdown::shortcode("slide-buttons")`

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_tabs(slide_details, "/slides/01-slides.html")
```

{{% div fyi %}}
**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
