.box-5.less-medium[What is the point of using control variables<br>if they aren't going to be interpreted?]

.box-5.less-medium[How do we know which coefficients we<br>need to ultimately worry about and interpret?]

---

.box-5.large[Why did we control for things<br>in the RCT section of problem set 8?]

---

.box-5.large[How can you NOT have unobserved confounders unless you're doing a laboratory study where you can control everything?]

---

.box-5.medium[Design-based inference seems easier since<br>there's no unobserved confounding?<br><br>Why don't we just do that all the time?]

???

Yeah, but you have to discover weird situations. Like WWII submarine thing!
